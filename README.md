This program uses several different raw audio files to produce compressed sound for the user. We will be building out six Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNâ€™s) for each of the six parameters of compression. Compression will be done through the six different parameters of audio signal processing which are: 


Threshold: Determines the level at which the compressor starts compressing

Ratio: Once the sound from the raw audio file exceeds the Threshold, the Ratio is what we use to level the sound

Attack: Determines how quickly it pulls the input signal down to the full ratio value when it exceeds the threshold

Release: Represents the total time it takes for the signal to return to an uncompressed state

Knee: Determines the character of the gain that is applied to the signal

Makeup Gain: When you want your raw audio file to sound louder
